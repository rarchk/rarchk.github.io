This is my personal website, where I share my thoughts, experiments and other literary works. It has been fun designing this website bit by bit.

Still not used to many frontend stuff,  

## Usage 
```bash
source site_tools.sh 
new_post # Creates a new post 
new_page # Creates a new page 
```
## Acknowledgements 
This is a jekyll template based on [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon). 

*Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.*

All the configurations are inside either `_config.yml` or `_config.scss`. The options are fairly straightforward. 

The theme supports: 

1. Theme colors: you can choose your favorite theme color
2. Changable sidebar locations
3. Integration of FontAwesome, MathJax, Disqus and Google Analytics
4. and numerous improvements over original Lanyon
