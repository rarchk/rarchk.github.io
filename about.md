Hi, I'm Ronak and I am a performance engineer.

I completed my masters in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad and my interest lies in distributed and high performance computing. . Currently, I'm involved in docker, golang and public clouds.
I'm always looking for growth oppertunites, and interested in working with some of the best people out there.
