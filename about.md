Hi, 

I like to think that I'm a systems engineer, but I'm still far away from learning all caveats of this field. 
I completed my masters in Computer Science from IIIT Hyderabad and my interest lies in distributed and high performance computing. 

Currently, I'm actively working on *containers and their applications in public cloud.* I've been interested in distributed tracing, debugging and Infrastructure as a Code lately. I'm always looking for growth opportunities in this field, and would be interested in working with people with similar or greater kind of passion.
