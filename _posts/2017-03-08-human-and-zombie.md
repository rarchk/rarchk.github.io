`[Verse 1]`

>	In the midst of a solemn night, 
>	a skewed zombie with no passion in his might. 
>
>	Walking askew-ed, sideways and cross-ways, 
>	rambling, why she be hungry always.
>
>	All silver and All gold, had lost its allure, 
>	a scarcity of human, it can't endure.


`[Verse 2]`


>	In the midst of a solemn night, 
>	he walked with a gust of delight.**
>
>	Thought a world filled with Mary Poppins, 
>	she sang, and his orchestra had Beethoven, Mozart and Chopin.
>
>	Apprehending his angst with curiosity,
>	it became, prepared and unaware. 


`[Verse 3]`

>	In the midst of solemn night, 
>	he was dull and she a petite. 
>
>	His unbiased hunger and her unquenched thirst, 
>	both needed each other, no matter who is first.
>
>	In that moment, they complemented each other,
>	one felt gratitude, and other became just matter.
