<p>Let’s look at this piece of code:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rarchk/83e16fb6dee003353e499320d3383888.js"></script>

<p>We all know that python has lists, tuples, dictionaries etc. where you can do array like operations like checking out length, setting or getting indexes, or iterating them in a loop.  With above code, we have basically made our hello function behave like one of those collections.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hello</span><span class="p">();</span> 
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="c"># tells us about representation form of this object </span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">];</span> 
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">:</span>
<span class="o">...</span>	<span class="k">print</span> <span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span> 

</code></pre>

<p>This all happened because python follows duck typing approach, where you do not check on type but fuctionality of an object at run time. In words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Martelli">Alex Martelli</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Don’t check whether it IS-a duck: check whether it QUACKS-like-a duck, WALKS-like-a duck, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In normal typing method, an object suitability is determined by an object’s type only whereas in duck typing, suitability is determined by presence of these methods/properties.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered, when you run a python program, and it runs fine unless it goes to a certain faulty function in its execution work flow. That happens because python only interprets a part of type’s structure that is accessed during runtime.</p>

<p>It is a powerful feature of python, and lets you help writing a more readable python code. Some people may call it magical methods and some may call it Dynamic binding too.</p>
